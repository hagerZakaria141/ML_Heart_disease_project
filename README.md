# ML Heart Disease Project

This project is a classification task to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze patient data and predict whether they are likely to have heart disease. The project uses Logistic Regression as the main model for classification.

## Files
- heart_disease_classification.ipynb : Main Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- heart_disease_data.csv : Dataset used for training and testing the model (if included).
- README.md : Project description and instructions.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook heart_disease_classification.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in order to see data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Notes
- Make sure to have all required Python libraries installed.
- Dataset should be in the same folder as the notebook for it to run correctly.
